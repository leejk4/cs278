# Assignment 2

## Overview

For this assignment, you will be adding a feature to the Dropbox implementation that was used as an example in class. You are free to dream up and implement any feature that you want. You will be graded on the complexity of the feature that you implement and the quality of your implementation.

## Implementation Considerations

1.	Your feature may later be integrated into a single code base that includes features implemented by your classmates. You should be cognizant of the potential need to integrate with other people’s code and be careful to minimize the changes to the core code base, make integrating your feature easy, and carefully encapsulate what you create.
2.	If you create tests for your code now, it may save you a lot of time and effort in a future assignment.
3.	You are free to use whatever Node modules you want, but you should make sure that they are properly included in your package.json and do not conflict with any modules already in use.

## Grading Standard

- 20% - Part 1 / feature complexity
- 30% - Part 1 / feature implementation quality
- 40% - Part 2 / code review quality of others’ solutions
- 10% - Part 3 / prompt and thoughtful handling of review pull requests

## Part 1: Instructions

1.	Clone the repo that you will be merging into https://github.com/cs4278-2015/assignment1-handin
2.	Create a branch titled submission/\<firstname\>\<lastname\> (e.g., submission/juleswhite) 
3.	Add your new feaure and any tests
4.	Commit your code to your submission branch
5.	Push your branch to GitHub (double check that it shows up on GitHub)

## Part 2: Instructions
1.	Complete code reviews for 2 of your peers using the process described in the home GitHub repo

## Part 3: Instructions
1.	Merge or reject (with detailed comments) all pull requests from your reviews


## Due Dates

1.	Part 1 with your code is due at 11:59pm on 9/6
2.	Part 2 with your code reviews of other peoples’ solutions is due at 10:00am on 9/8 and will be presented in class
3.  Part 3 is due before class on 9/10
