# Assignment 4

## Overview

Expect this assignment to be very difficult. Start early.

For this assignment, you will be creating a single Dropbox implementation that merges all of the new features created by the class into a single application. You will be responsible for ensuring that your code has been updated to address your code review comments, compiles, runs correctly, and does not break anyone else’s code. 

## Instructions

1.	Clone the repo that you will be merging into https://github.com/cs4278-2015/assignment4-handin
2.	Create a branch titled unmerged/\<firstname\>\<lastname\> (e.g., unmerged/juleswhite) 
3.	Fix all refactorings that were required for your code for Asgn 3 by accepting the pull requests and making any changes that they necessitated.
4.	Put your refactored code into your unmerged/\<firstname\>\<lastname\> branch and push it to the server – you should check on GitHub to ensure that your branch is there and all of your code is in it
5.	Follow all merging rules and processes discussed in class
6.	Create a branch titled merged/\<firstname\>\<lastname\> (e.g., merged/juleswhite)
7.	Place your complete working copy of the merged code for the entire class into your merged branch
8.	Push your working copy of the merged branch to the website to handin your code – check GitHub to make sure it shows up and your working code is there 

## Due Dates

1.	Your unmerged branch with your corrected code must be committed and pushed to GitHub by 11:59pm on 9/25. If you do not make the first deadline, you will lose 25% on your assignment – there will be no extensions.
2.	You must push your merged branch of the entire code base by 11:59pm on 10/2

## Ground Rules

1.	If you break it, you fix it. If you introduce failing tests, bugs, or compile errors in the process of merging your code into the combined code base, you are responsible for fixing them. Under no circumstance should you push code that breaks what another person has committed. The later you start and merge your code in, the harder this assignment is going to be.
2.	You should only push code to branches that are not yours through pull requests

## Hints

1.	Those who start early will have less work merging their code into the main code base
2.	If the class works as a whole with a strategy, this assignment will be MUCH easier
3.	If you go solo on this assignment, expect it to be incredibly difficult.
