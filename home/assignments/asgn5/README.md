# Assignment 5

## Overview

For this assignment, you will be designing a software engineering assignment for a team
of 3 of your classmates. You will design the requirements for the software that they create, the development process that they must follow, and the deliverables that they
must produce. For the next assignment, your specification will be assigned to another team
and they will be required to complete it.

## Part 1 Instructions

1. Clone the assignment handin repo: https://github.com/cs4278-2015/assignment5-handin

2. Create and checkout a branch titled submission/\<firstname\>\<lastname\> (e.g.,submission/juleswhite) 

3.	You must design a development process for a team of your fellow students. You must consider the realities of "college development" where your team is not composed of people working full time on the software. Your process should be delivered as a PROCESS.md file. Your process should include considerations for the following:
  - Will the team meet in person or not? If so, how often and for how long?
  - Will the team meet virtually? If so, how? What will the meetings look like?
  - What will be the format of any in-person or virtual meetings?
  - Will the team use other tools like Slack or GroupMe?
  - How will progress on the project be tracked?
  - How will the work be broken down into units and assigned to team members?
  - What will be the structure of the Git repo? What are the rules for branching and committing?
  - What is the standard for testing? Do you require code coverage metrics, if so, what?
  - How should the team handle team members that aren't pulling their weight or are struggling?
  - How should the team handle non-responsive team members?
  - What documentation must be provided?
  - How will the team track bugs?
  - What are expectations on interaction with you (the customer) to make sure that the team builds the right thing?
  - What are the coding standards?
  - How should the team handle change requests to you (particularly for scope)?
  - How will adherence to the process be measured?
  
4. You must design NodeJS assignment that a team of 3 of your peers can implement in one week. You should put the specification into a SPEC.md file. Your specification must include:
  - an overview description of the assignment
  - a set of user stories
  - software and documentation artifacts that you want delivered
  - a quantitative grading guide for the functional aspects of the software
  - a qualitative grading guide for the code style, design, and other aspects
  - a grading guide for how well your process was used
  - a grading guide for assessing each team member's contribution

5. Commit your PROCESS.md and SPEC.md files to your submission branch and push it to GitHub.  

## Grading Standard

- 50% - process description quality & completeness
- 50% - assignment description quality, completeness, and scoping for one week of work

## Due Dates

1.	Due at 10:00am on 10/6
